This very simple Slack model was built as the final assignment of the book "Pure React" by Dave Ceddia.

The project uses React, Sass, moment, uuid.

Features include: 
  * A list of Channels 
  * A list of Users 
  * Maintain state for the currently-selected Channel or User 
  * Click a Channel or User to select it 
  * Only one Channel or User can be selected at a time 
  * Each Channel and User has its own history of messages 
  * Generate some fake messages for each channel 
  * Show an input box at the bottom, only when a Channel or User is selected 
  * Typing in the input box and hitting ENTER should add that message to the selected Channel/ User and clear the input.
